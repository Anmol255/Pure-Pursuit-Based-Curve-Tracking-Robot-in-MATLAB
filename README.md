# Pure-Pursuit-Based-Curve-Tracking-Robot-in-MATLAB
Developed a MATLAB-based autonomous curve tracking robot using a Pure Pursuit steering control algorithm. The robot dynamically identifies the nearest point on a predefined sinusoidal trajectory and selects a look-ahead target point to compute steering corrections.
